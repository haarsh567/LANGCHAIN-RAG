# LANGCHAIN-RAG
Title: Practical Language Model Integration with LangChain: A Chatbot and Multifunctional RAG Pipeline

Description:

This repository showcases a practical exploration of LangChain for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like Ollama's Llama2, Mistral, and Hugging Face models (GPT-3.5 is not directly supported) into chatbot development. It demonstrates advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline creation for training on diverse datasets and explores the multi-functionality of RAG. Additionally, it delves into the practical understanding of LangChain's core concepts: retrievers, chains, APIs, and agents.

Key Highlights:

Chatbot Creation: Implements a chatbot using LLMs, enabling interaction with users.
Advanced RAG Pipeline: Creates a multi-stage RAG pipeline for training on different datasets, enhancing query-response accuracy.
Multifunctional RAG: Explores the use cases of RAG beyond its standard application in chatbot systems.
LangChain Fundamentals: Provides practical explanations of retriever, chain, API, and agent concepts within LangChain.
LangChain Exploration: Utilizes LangSmith and LangServer components for potential future research directions.
GROQ Integration: Leverages GROQ inferencing engine for possible data extraction and manipulation.
Web Data Handling: Demonstrates using WebBaseLoader to fetch data from websites and employing RecursiveTextSplitter for chunking.
PDF Data Processing: Investigates the utility of LangChain with Hugging Face models for processing PDF data (potential future work).
LLM Selection: Explores the use of Ollama's Llama2, Mistral, Mixtral (potentially a typo), GPT-3.5 (indirectly through Hugging Face), and other Hugging Face models.
