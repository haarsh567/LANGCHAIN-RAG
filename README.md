# LangChain Integration: Chatbot and Multifunctional RAG Pipeline

Welcome to the LangChain Integration repository, where we explore the practical implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Ollama's Llama2, Mistral, and Hugging Face models within the LangChain framework. This project focuses on creating advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and demonstrates the multi-functionality of RAG beyond traditional chatbot applications.

## Key Highlights

### 1. Chatbot Creation
- Develops a chatbot using LLMs to facilitate interactive user interactions.

### 2. Advanced RAG Pipeline
- Constructs a multi-stage RAG pipeline for training on diverse datasets to enhance query-response accuracy.

### 3. Multifunctional RAG
- Explores various use cases of RAG, showcasing its versatility beyond standard chatbot applications.

### 4. LangChain Fundamentals
- Provides practical explanations of LangChain core concepts: retrievers, chains, APIs, and agents.

### 5. LangChain Exploration
- Utilizes LangSmith and LangServer components for potential research directions and extensions.

### 6. GROQ Integration
- Leverages the GROQ inferencing engine for data extraction and manipulation tasks.

### 7. Web Data Handling
- Demonstrates fetching data from websites using WebBaseLoader and employs RecursiveTextSplitter for text chunking.

### 8. PDF Data Processing
- Investigates LangChain's utility with Hugging Face models for processing PDF data (future work).

### 9. LLM Selection
- Explores the usage of Ollama's Llama2, Mistral, Mixtral, Hugging Face models (including GPT-3.5 via Hugging Face), and other available models.
